/*
 * AUTHOR: Angel Fern√°ndez Camba
 * DATE: Long time ago...
 * DESCRIPTION: 
 * Write a program to read a string and copy the second word into another one. 
 * This will be executed by means of a function Transform() that will 
 * work with two strings, copying characters from string1 to string2.
 *
 * The first string string1 is declared in main as a static array of characters. 
 * On the other hand, string2 will be allocated dynamic memory and has to be declared 
 * in main as a pointer to char. 
 * The program will follow these steps:
 *
 * Read string1 by means of fgets function (safe version of gets ).
 *
 * Call a function CountWord() to the number of characters of the second word in the string1.
 * The objective is to determine the length of the second string2 (and pass this length 
 * back by reference).
 *
 * Allocate dynamic memory for string2 by means of calloc
 *
 * Call the function void Transform(char *string1, char *string2) to fill string2 as
 * specified. (Remember that this protopype is equivelent to the following ones: )
 * void Transform(char string1[], char *string2);
 * void Transform(char string1[], char string2[]);
 *
 * Display both string1 and string2
 * 
 * Release memory previously allocated for string2 .
 * 
 * Watch out: The following special cases should be considered in CountWord() and Transform():
 *
 * The original string could be empty or have just one word. In that case, the resulting 
 * string will be also empty.
