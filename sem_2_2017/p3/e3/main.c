 * DESCRIPTION:
 * Write a program that defines a constant integer number called SECRET 
 * by using #define .
 * Then write a loop that allows the user to play against the computer 
 * to guess that secret number. The loop must:
 * Request a number
 * Compare the number introduced by the uset with the constant SECRET
 * Indicate if the user has guessed the secret number of if the 
 * SECRET number is smaller/larger.
 * 
 * The loop will be repeated until the user guesses the number.

	int i = 0; //Loop counter
	
	//Ask user for input till is the secret
	do{
		printf("\nIntroduce the password:");
		scanf("%d", &user_secret);

			printf("Wrong: Password is greater than %d", user_secret);

			printf("Wrong: Password is less than %d", user_secret);

		//Increase number of tries
		i++;
