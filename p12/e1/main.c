/*
 * AUTHOR: Angel Fern√°ndez Camba
 * DATE: Long time ago...
 * DESCRIPTION: Write a program that creates a file ( library.dat ) 
 * to store all the information about the books in a library. For each book, 
 * the information that must be stored is the following (use a structure called T_BOOK):
 *
 * Book title
 * Author
 * Date of purchase (structure type T_DATE containing three fields: day, month, year)
 * The program begins by requesting the number of books in the library, 
 * then it will ask the user the information related with all the books in the 
 * library, in order to write such information in the file. It is not necessary 
 * to store the information of the books in arrays. A function called ReadOneBook() must 
 * be used to read from the keyboard the information of each book (call this function 
 * inside a loop in main()). 
 *
 * Once a book has been read, it will be stored in the binary file. The prototype 
 * of the function ReadOneBook() is:
 * T_BOOK ReadOneBook(void);
 * Note: Write another version of the function ReadoneBook() using pointers to 
 * give back the structure.
