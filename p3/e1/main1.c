 * DESCRIPTION:
 * The value of the function 1/(1+x) can be calculated approximately by 
 * summing the first n terms of the infinite series:
 * 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 + ...
 *
 * Write a program that will read and validate the values for n and x and then display the 
 * approximate value of the function (values of x between 0 and 1).
 *
 * There are two ways to solve this problem:
 * Obtain the general term of the series as a function of the iteration counter (i).
 * Compute the i th term by multiplying the i-1 term by -x.
 *
 * Write the program in two ways.
