 * DESCRIPTION:
 * Write a program to calculate the equivalent resistor of two resistors connected in series and in parallel.
 * Given the resistors R1 and R2, the equivalent resistors are calculated as:
 * Series:
 * Req_Series = R1 + R2
 *
 * Parallel:
 * Req_Paral = (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2)
 *
 * Execute the program typing in the values de r1 = 2.0 y r2 = 1.0.
 * Display 2 decimal places of the calculated resistors (using %.2f).
